The purpose of this project is to analyze candidates votes and be able to list and display the results as well as the winners. 

1. Caluclate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate thetotal number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.63.2

## Summary
The results of the elections are shown below:
- There was a total of 369,711 votes.
- The three candidates were: 
  -  Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the votes and 85,213 votes.
  - Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes

- The winner of the election was: 
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the votes being 85,213 votes.'

## Challenge Overview
Python was ued to calculate the data and be able to find the results for the election. We were able to extract data from a CSV file and create variable with different data types. We are also used lists, typles and dictionaries in the process. Visual Studio Code was used along with the Python software to find the outcomes of the elections. The results deomonstrated that the largwst county turnover was in Denver.  The results also demonstrated that Diana Degette won the elections with 272, 892 votes which results in a winning percentage of 73.8%

## Challenge Summary

This script of code can be modified to create different sets of elections as well. Firstly, the csv woould have to be changed as well as the list of dictionaries according to the elections results file for the specific elections file. It would also be critical to add the different counties or areas that are involved in the election results. The row where the election results extraction occurs also varies depending on the structure of the header.
